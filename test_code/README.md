# Test Code

This folder contains all test code and scripts for the leader-follower robot project.

## Contents

- `bump_sensor_logger.ino`: Logs RC timing data for bump sensors and calibrates min/max values.
- `follower_dual_pid.ino`: Implements a follower robot with dual PID control for distance and direction.
- `leader_multi_mode.ino`: Implements a leader robot with three movement modes (constant speed, variable speed, circle).
- `line_sensor_logger.ino`: Logs RC timing data for line sensors and calibrates min/max values.
- `follower_stable.ino`: Stable version of the follower robot, combining RC and ADC data for distance estimation.

## Usage

Refer to individual script documentation for usage instructions.
