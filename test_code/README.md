# Test Code

This folder contains all test code and scripts for the leader-follower robot project.

## Contents

- `bumpsensor_rc_test.ino`: Logs RC timing data for bump sensors and calibrates min/max values.
- `final_follower.ino`: Implements a follower robot with dual PID control for distance and direction.
- `leader_3modeversion.ino`: Implements a leader robot with three movement modes (constant speed, variable speed, circle).
- `linesensor_rc_test.ino`: Logs RC timing data for line sensors and calibrates min/max values.
- `linesensor_without_turn.ino`: Stable version of the follower robot, combining RC and ADC data for distance estimation.

## Usage

Refer to individual script documentation for usage instructions.
